# Public Transit Service Analysis  

Overview

Public transit systems behave as a collection of interacting services, each influenced by calendar cycles, commuter patterns, events, and external disruptions.  
This analysis uncovers **five key insights** that reveal how different services respond to real-world conditions.

# Key Findings

## 1. School Service Operates Like a “Binary Calendar Switch”
- Around 47% of days contain zero School trips**.
- When active, ridership jumps instantly to 4,000–7,000, showing no gradual rise.
- Behavior aligns almost perfectly with academic calendars.
  
**Insight:** School service is *schedule-driven*, not demand-driven.


## 2.  “Other” Service Has Rare but Explosive Surges
- Normally tiny (**median-40 trips/day**).
- On rare dates, it spikes to **1,000+ trips**, a **25× surge**.
- Not correlated with any major categories.

Likely represents:
- Event shuttles  
- Temporary diversions  
- Emergency operations  

**Insight:** These anomalies are a **hidden operational signal** only visible through data.

## 3.  Rapid Route = The System’s “Shock Absorber”
- Highest overall ridership.
- Exhibits **extreme spikes** far above its median.
- Reacts strongly to:
  - Festivals  
  - Road closures  
  - System disruptions  

**Insight:** Rapid services absorb sudden mobility demand before other modes do.

## 4. Light Rail Has the Most Unstable Market Share
- Absolute numbers are steady.
- But **its % share fluctuates the most** among all services.
- Indicates **mode-switching behavior**:
  - When other services spike or drop, riders substitute Light Rail disproportionately.

**Insight:** Light Rail is highly sensitive to changes elsewhere in the system.

## 5. Local, Rapid, and Light Rail Move in Near-Perfect Unison  
- Correlation among the three: **0.96–0.97**.
- Peak Service does not follow this pattern.
- Peak trips depend heavily on:
  - Workday schedules  
  - Commuter timing patterns  

**Insight:** Peak Service is independent and follows work structure, not urban mobility conditions.
